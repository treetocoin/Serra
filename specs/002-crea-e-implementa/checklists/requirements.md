# Specification Quality Checklist: Actuator Management and Sensor-Actuator Automation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for Planning

**Resolution**:
- Conflicting automation rules clarification resolved: Priority system with user-assigned priority numbers (1 = highest priority)
- Added FR-033 through FR-036 for priority and conflict resolution
- Updated Automation Rule entity to include priority number
- Added acceptance scenarios 7-8 to User Story 3 for priority management

**Next Steps**:
- Specification is complete and validated
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
